# About This Project

This is a generative, stochastic audio tool that creates endless chord progressions using Markov chain based on simple circle of fifths relations. Alternatively, you can input your own chord progression to generate endless variations of it. The generated progressions are then played through a simple synthesizer.

The circle visualization shows the current chord (highlighted) and its position in the circle of fifths. Major chords are shown in the outer ring, with their relative minors in the inner ring.

The tempo, octave, and waveform can be adjusted to your liking. Experiment with effects like reverb, delay, and lowpass filter. Toggle arpeggio mode to hear the chords played as sequential notes rather than simultaneously.
